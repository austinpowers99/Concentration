# Sam's Concentration Game 💥

Your mission is to match all of the cards on the screen before the timer runs out and before you're out of moves! You'll need to sharpen your memory and quick thinking to succeed. 

The game contains three levels to choose from, and you may start at any of them.

## How to play
1. Click the Start button to begin!
2. Win by matching all the cards!
3. Lose if you use up all attempts before matching all the cards.
4. If you choose two cards that don't match, the second card will flip back over, and you'll lose a move.
5. After winning or using all available attempts, restart by clicking the Start button again.
